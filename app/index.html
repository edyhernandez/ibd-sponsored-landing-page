                            <p>Industry research indicates that the number of financial advisors overall has steadily declined since 2005-a decrease exacerbated by the 2008 financial crisis. The outlook is far more positive for the RIA channel. In fact, research indicates that the RIA channel is one of the only channels showing sustained growth. It added more than 30,000 advisors from 2004 to 2014, including dually registered.<sup>1</sup> The growth in assets within the RIA channel was even more pronounced, increasing 174% from 2005 to 2014.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <h3>Benefits: RIA Gives You Greater Freedom</h3>
                    <p>Choosing independence as an RIA is agood for business. Advisors cite numerous benefits to becoming an independent advisor, including greater autonomy and the potential for a larger income. However, much of it boils down to a single concept: control.</p>
                    <p>In a 2012 study, Schwab asked asvisors at large firms why they found the RIA model appealing. Although the responses varied, they all shared a common theme: Advisors wanted a bigger say in how the business was run. <span class="bold">Here are some of the benefits they identified:</span></p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-8">
                            <p><span class="bold">Autonomy.</span> RIAs have the final word on all decisions related to the business. They decide everything from the compensation structure to the technology platform to the sign on the office door. RIAs determine how much of their revenue they keep up-up to 100%, depending on the model of independence they choose. They can assert complete control over fees and expenses, choosing only the products and services they need. Owners can also build equity as their firms grow, leading to a higher long-term pay-out should they choose to monetize or sell the business down the road.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Client flexibility.</span> While most advisors say they put a high priority on client relationships, the RIA model helps them deliver on that promise. Independent advisors can decide how to engage and communicate with clients-from building a marketing plan to creating a customized product portfolio for each client.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Access to the right tools.</span> RIAs can choose the technology and platform that best suit their specific needs. The latest portfolio management and customer relationship management (CRM) systems make it easier to streamline workflows, access crucial information, and serve clients-all while adapting to an advisor's key priorities.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Commission Structure.</span> RIAs with successful brokerage businesses don't have to choose one model over another. With the hybrid model, advisors can offer advisory services as an RIA while keeping their commission-based business by affiliating with a third-party Independent Broker Dealer.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Compliance options.</span> RIAs have more options when it comes to managing compliance. They can conduct compliance in-house or turn to a third party for help, freeing up more time for clients.</p>

                    <h3>Putting Clients First</h3>
                    <p>For advisors, acting in their clients' best interests is a key principle. But pressure to sell particular products or deliver returns to shareholders can take priority in some firms - Independent RIA firms face no such pressures they have the freedom to put clients and their goals above all else.</p>

                    <p>"Advice is the most important thing you offer to your clients," says Leo Arms, who owns Thomas Leo Advisory, an RIA firm in Minneapolis. "They can get the transaction at many different places." The role of an independent advisor, he says, is to listen to what clients need, help them, offer advice, and "ultimately be compensated for the advice you offer."</p>
